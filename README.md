# Cuter Weblinks

Joomla Module to display Weblinks neatly

## Description

Weblinks is an interesting component in Joomla that exists since its early age, once being an integral part of Joomla and since a while available as separate extension. Weblinks is a nice way to collect and categorize links to anywhere in the internet. The component itself is quite comprehensive and shows a nice overview of either categories and/or a category's entries. It also provides its own module, which is quite powerful but also restricted in how it displays links. Hence, here we have Cuter Weblinks, providing an alternative module to display links.

## Features

Choose to display entries from one, some, or all categories.
Limit the number of entries to be shown.
Sort by order, alphabetically or publication date.
Decide upon which elements to show.
Add some prologue and/or epilogue text if desired.
Links are created according to Weblink style and may be opened in the same or a new window/tab.
